        <div class="col-md-12 content">
          Sabiha Gökçen (22 March 1913 – 22 March 2001) was a Turkish aviator.
          She was the world's first female fighter pilot, aged 23. Others such
          as Marie Marvingt and Evgeniya Shakhovskaya preceded her as military
          pilots in other roles, but not as fighter pilots and without military
           academy enrollment. She was an orphan, and one of the thirteen
           adopted children of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. She is recognized as the
           first female combat pilot by The Guinness Book of World Records and
           was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "The 20
           Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air
           Force in 1996.
           <br />
           <br />
           Atatürk attached great importance to aviation and for that purpose
           oversaw the foundation of the Turkish Aeronautical Association in
           1925. He took Sabiha along with him to the opening ceremony of
           Türkkuşu (Turkishbird) Flight School on 5 May 1935. During the
           airshow of gliders and parachutists invited from foreign countries,
           she got very excited. As Atatürk asked her whether she would also
           want to become a skydiver, she nodded "yes indeed, I am ready right
           now". Atatürk instructed Fuat Bulca, the head of the school, to
           enroll her as the first female trainee. She was meant to become a
           skydiver, but she was much more interested in flying, so she earned
           her pilot's licence. Gökçen was sent to Russia, together with seven
           male students, for an advanced course in glider and powered aircraft
           piloting. However, when she was in Moscow, she learned the news that
           her sister Zehra had died, and with collapsed morale, she immediately
           returned to Turkey, isolating herself from social activities for some
           time.
          <br />
           As girls were not being accepted by the Turkish War Academies in
           those years, Sabiha Gökçen was provided, on Atatürk's orders, with
           a personalized uniform, and attended a special education programme
           of eleven months at the Tayyare Mektebi (Aviation School) in Eskişehir
           in the academic year 1936-1937. After receiving her flight patents (diploma)
           she trained to become a war pilot at the 1st Airplane Regiment in
           Eskişehir for six months.
           <br />
           She improved her skills by flying bomber and fighter planes at the
           1st Aircraft Regiment in Eskişehir Airbase and gained experience
           after participating in the Aegean and Thrace exercises in 1937. In
           that same year, she took part in military operations at the Dersim
           rebellion and became the first Turkish female air force combat pilot.
           A report of the General Staff mentioned the "serious damage" that
           had been caused by her 50 kg bomb to a group of fifty fleeing
           "bandits" and she was awarded with a takdirname
           (letter of appreciation). She was also awarded the Turkish
           Aeronautical Association's first "Murassa (Jeweled) Medal" for her
           superior performance in this operation.
           <br />
           In 1938, she carried out a five-day flight around the Balkan
           countries to great acclaim. In the same year, she was appointed
           "chief trainer" of the Türkkuşu Flight School of the Turkish
           Aeronautical Association, where she served until 1954 as a flight
           instructor and became a member of the association's executive board.
           She trained four female aviators, Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman,
           Sahavet Karapas and Nezihe Viranyalı. Sabiha Gökçen flew around the
           world for a period of 28 years until 1964. Her book entitled "A Life
           Along the Path of Atatürk" was published in 1981 by the Turkish
           Aeronautical Association to commemorate Atatürk's 100th birthday.
           <br />
           Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22
           different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of
           which were active combat and bombardment missions.
